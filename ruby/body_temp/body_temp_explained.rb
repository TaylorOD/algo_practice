# We're creating software that analyez the date of body temperature readings taken from hundreds of human patients.
# These readings are taken from healthy people and range from 97.0 degrees Fahrenheit to 99.0 degrees Fahrenheit.
# An important point: Within this application, the decimal point never goes beyond the tenth place.
# Write an algoithm that sorts these readings from lowest to heighest.
# Write it faster than O(N log N) - Which is possible because there is a limited quantity of possible readings.

# Example:
# Input:
# [98.6, 98.0, 97.1, 99.0, 98.9, 97.8, 98.5, 98.2, 98.0, 97.1]

# Output:
# [97.1, 97.1, 97.8, 98.0, 98.0, 98.2, 98.5, 98.6, 98.9, 99.0]
