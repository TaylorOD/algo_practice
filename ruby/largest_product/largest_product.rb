# Write a function that accepts an array of numbers and computes the highest product of any two numbers in the array.
# At first glace this is easy as we can just find the two greatest nubers and mulitply them.
# However, our array can contain negative numbers and look like this: [5, -10, -6, 9, 4]
# In this case it's actually the product of the two lowerest numbers, -10 and -6 that would yield the highest product of 60.

# Write a solution that is O(N)

# Example:
# Input:
# [5, -10, -6, 9, 4]

# Output:
# 60
