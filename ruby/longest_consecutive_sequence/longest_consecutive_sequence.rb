# Youre writing a function that accepts an array of unsorted integers and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence amoung them.
#  The sequence is formed by integers that increase by 1. For example:

# Example:
# Input:
# [10, 5, 12, 3, 55, 30, 4, 11, 2]

# [19,13, 15, 12, 18, 14, 17, 11]
# Output:
# [2, 3, 4, 5] is the sequence. 4 is the return value.

# [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] is the sequence. 5 is the return value.

# Do this in O(N) time.
