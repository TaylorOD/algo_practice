// There is a numerical sequence known as "Triangular Numbers."
// The pattern begins as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, and continues onward with the Nth number in the pattern which is N plus the previous number.
// For example the 7th number in the sequence is 28 since it's 7 (which is N) plus 21 (the previous number in the sequence).
// Write a function that accepts a number for N and returns the correct number fro the series.
// Example:
// Input:
// 7
// Output:
// 28

// Input:
// 9
// Output:
// 45

const triangularNumbers = function (inputNumber) {

}

console.log(triangularNumbers(7))
// console.log(triangularNumbers(9))
