// Write a function that returns the intersection of two arrays.
// The intersection is a third array that contains all values contained within the first two arrays.

// Input:
// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

// Output:
// [2, 4]

// Your function should have a time complexity of O(N).
// Do not use any build in programing language methods to do this.
// Use a hash table in your solution.
