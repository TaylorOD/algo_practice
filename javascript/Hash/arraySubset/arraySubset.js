// Given two arrays, determine whether one is a subset of the other. It is considered a subset if all the values in one array are contained within the other.

// NOTE: You must accomplish this in O(n) time. This is also known as linear time.

// Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [6, 3, 2]
// Output: true

// Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [6, 3, 7]
// Output: false
