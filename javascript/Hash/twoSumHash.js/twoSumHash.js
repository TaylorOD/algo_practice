// This is the same exercise as Two Sum I, but you must now solve it in linear time.

// Given an array of numbers, return a new array containing just two numbers (from the original array) that add up to the number 10. If there are no two numbers that add up to 10, return false.

// Input: [2, 5, 3, 1, 0, 7, 11]
// Output: [3, 7]

// Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Output: false (While 1, 2, 3, and 4 altogether add up to 10, we're seeking just one pair of numbers.)
