// My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.

// I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

// Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!

// To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

// The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (takeOutOrders)
// The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dineInOrders)
// Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by the kitchen. (servedOrders)
// Given all three arrays, write a function to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.

// We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.

// As an example,

//   Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
//  Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
//   Served Orders: [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]
// would not be first-come, first-served, since order 3 was requested before order 5 but order 5 was served first.

// But,

//   Take Out Orders: [17, 8, 24]
//  Dine In Orders: [12, 19, 2]
//   Served Orders: [17, 8, 12, 19, 24, 2]
// would be first-come, first-served.

// Note: Order numbers are arbitrary. They do not have to be in increasing order.

// Create function take thats in three arrays
const isFirstComeFirstServed = function (takeOutArray, dineInArray, servedOrdersArray) {
  // Create index at the start of each dine in and take out arrays
  let takeOutIndex = 0
  let dineInIndex = 0
  // Create a max to check that we don't go over the max length of the array
  let takeOutIndexMax = takeOutArray.length - 1
  let dineInIndexMax = dineInArray.length - 1
  // Create a for loop that will move through the servedOrdersArray
  for (let index = 0; index < servedOrdersArray.length; index += 1) {
    // Create an order variable that will be the servedOrdersArray[index]
    let order = servedOrdersArray[index]
    // If the take out index isnt greater than the max and the order equals the take out array, increment the take out index
    if (takeOutIndex <= takeOutIndexMax && order === takeOutArray[takeOutIndex]) {
      takeOutIndex += 1
      // Same as above but for dine in index
    } else if (dineInIndex <= dineInIndexMax && order === dineInArray[dineInIndex]) {
      dineInIndex += 1
      // If neither are true then return false because its not first some first serve
    } else {
      return false
    }
  }
  // If we make it through then return true because its first some first serve
  return true
}
// Call out function with two test inputs
console.log(isFirstComeFirstServed([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]))
console.log(isFirstComeFirstServed([17, 8, 24], [12, 19, 2], [17, 8, 12, 19, 24, 2]))
